I want to make a tourist attraction recommendation
system in seoul. 

I want to build a program for tourists visiting
Seoul South Korea. 

Users well be able to search for different attraction
types and the app will recommend relevent attractions.

What does the program do? 
It takes in queries based on catagories and returns
a list of possible results.

catagories could be:

themes -- e.g. Historical, Fashion, Culinary/Food
